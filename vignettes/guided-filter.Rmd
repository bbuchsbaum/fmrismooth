Guided filtering is a fast, edge‑preserving smoother. Unlike bilateral filtering, it assumes a local linear model between the output and a guide image within each window. The regularization parameter prevents overfitting across noisy regions and avoids edge leakage.

This vignette shows how to use the 3D and 4D guided filters and how to choose their parameters.

## Spatial guided filtering (3D)

The 3D variant processes one volume using a sliding window. The window radius controls spatial scale; the regularization `eps` sets how “rigid” the fit is to the guide: small values track edges more closely, larger values behave more like an averaging filter.

```{r}
d3 <- c(10, 10, 10)
vol <- array(100, dim = d3)
vol[6:10, , ] <- vol[6:10, , ] + 20
noisy <- vol + array(rnorm(prod(d3), sd = 6), dim = d3)

gf_smooth <- guided_filter3d(noisy, radius = 2L, eps = 0.5^2)
gf_rigid  <- guided_filter3d(noisy, radius = 2L, eps = 1.5^2)

c(var_noisy = var(as.vector(noisy)),
  var_smooth = var(as.vector(gf_smooth)),
  var_rigid  = var(as.vector(gf_rigid)))
```

Using the input itself as the guide is common. You can also pass an external guide, for example a T1 anatomical, to steer the filter across low‑contrast fMRI regions.

## Spatiotemporal guided filtering (4D)

The 4D variant applies the spatial guided filter to each frame, then an optional temporal guided step per voxel. The temporal radius sets how many frames on either side to include; `eps_t` plays the same role as in space. Motion‑aware temporal weights can down‑weight transitions between frames with large motion changes.

```{r}
d4 <- c(8, 8, 8, 14)
x <- array(100, dim = d4) + array(rnorm(prod(d4), sd = 5), dim = d4)

out_no_temp <- guided_filter4d(x, radius_sp = 2L, eps_sp = 0.6^2, radius_t = 0L)
out_temp    <- guided_filter4d(x, radius_sp = 2L, eps_sp = 0.6^2, radius_t = 1L, eps_t = 0.3^2)

c(var_no_temp = var(as.vector(out_no_temp)),
  var_temp    = var(as.vector(out_temp)))
```

When you have per‑frame motion parameters, supply them as `motion_params`; the filter will dampen temporal averaging across high‑motion transitions.

## Choosing parameters

Start with `radius = 2`–`3` voxels and `eps` near the noise variance. For 4D, a temporal radius of 1 with a modest `eps_t` often helps without washing out transients. If edges look washed out, reduce `eps`; if banding or over‑fitting appears, increase it.
